# Spending_Tracker

Thank you for taking a look at my first iOS application. Here are some of the things I want you to know.

1. The app is created using storyboard, so many constraints and seagues are set on the storyboard
2. Images used are not in this repo since I drew them and it's kind of embarassing to show them here

And here are some potential future improvements

1. make use of Firebase for storing and accessing user's data for preventing any accidental data loss by uninstalling the app
2. use SQL database to query and read users data for data analysis
3. use AI for reading recept and invoices for auto categorization and update of expenses
4. AI for better expense prediction
5. (Idk if that's possible but) connect the app to wallet and automatically update user's spending
